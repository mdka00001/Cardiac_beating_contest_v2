## Overview

This tool analyzes videos of monolayer cardiomyocyte contractions to assess beating frequency and other metrics of contractility. It uses video processing techniques and an optical flow-based approach to track and measure movement over time, allowing users to calculate the frequency and characteristics of cardiomyocyte contractions.

## Features
- **Video-based Analysis**: Supports both `.mp4` and `.avi` video formats.
- **Optical Flow Tracking**: Calculates beating frequency through motion tracking.
- **Customizable Output**: Options for saving processed videos to specified output paths.

## Installation

This application requires a Conda environment to manage dependencies. Use the provided `environment.yaml` file to create the environment. Ensure you have Conda installed.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monolayer-cardiomyocyte-frequency-analysis.git
